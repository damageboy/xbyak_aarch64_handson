# Hands on: Try Arm SVE on Docker

## Summary

This is a hands-on document for people who don't have an actual machine to try Arm SVE on Docker.

To have an environment to try Arm SVE with QEMU, just run the following command.

```sh
docker run -it kaityo256/xbyak_aarch64_handson
```

Once the container process is up, you will see a screen like the one below.

```sh
$ docker run -it kaityo256/xbyak_aarch64_handson
[user@2cd82e1ea4e3 ~]$
```

This is an image of ArchLinux with the necessary software pre-installed. In the following, you will try ARM SVE with intrinsic functions and Xbyak_aarch64.

## Intrinsic Functiosn

You can use Arm SVE instructions via intrinsic function of C language, which is called the Arm C Language Extensions (ACLEs) for SVE. The sample codes for the intrinsic functions are in the directory `~/xbyak_aarch64_handson/sample/intrinsic`.

### 1. SVE Length

Since the length of the vector is *scalble*, and the length is not determined at compile time. So, let's first look at a sample that gets the vector length at runtime.

The sample code can be built as follows.

```sh
cd 01_sve_length/
make
```

Then you can run the executable using QEMU.

```sh
$ qemu-aarch64 ./a.out
SVE is available. The length is 512 bits
```

You can specify the vector length in the QEMU options.

```sh
$ qemu-aarch64 -cpu max,sve128=on ./a.out
SVE is available. The length is 128 bits

$ qemu-aarch64 -cpu max,sve256=on ./a.out
SVE is available. The length is 256 bits
```

Here is the source code (`sve_length.cpp`).

```sh
#include <cstdio>
#ifdef __ARM_FEATURE_SVE
#include <arm_sve.h>
#endif

int main() {
  int n = 0;
#ifdef __ARM_FEATURE_SVE
  n = svcntb() * 8;
#endif
  if (n) {
    printf("SVE is available. The length is %d bits\n", n);
  } else {
    printf("SVE is unavailable.\n");
  }
}
```

Whether or not ARM SVE can be used can be determined by whether or not __ARM_FEATURE_SVE is defined. If `__ARM_FEATURE_SVE` is defined, then you can use intrinsic functions for SVE by including `arm_sve.h`.

The vector length can be obtained by `svcntb()` which returns the vector length in bytes. The corresponding instruction is `cntb`. The name of a ACLE SVE function consists of a prefix `sv` followed by the corresponding instruction in lower case.

In order to enable SVE, you need to compile with the `-march=armv8-a+sve` option. Without the option, `__ARM_FEATURE_SVE` will not be defined.

```sh
$ aarch64-linux-gnu-g++ -static sve_length.cpp
$ qemu-aarch64 ./a.out
SVE is unavailable.
```
